# Controller-Mapper

## What made me do it
I got bored and I was just starting to refresh my memory on python when I saw my nintendo switch controller and thought "Hey has anyone ever actually used that to code?"

## What's the use?
It allows for a more "laid back" approach to coding as it does require very little effort to use. However, I don't recommend it for constant use as it is quite slow to use in my opinion.

## Keybinds:
#### Can be customised but some values have to be changed
Format: Key: Action(Action is Alt is pressed)
```
ZR: Selection
ZL: Alt Button
L: Paste (Copy)
R: Cycle Button
X: Tab
A: Space
Y: Backspace
B: Enter
DPad: Arrow keys (Ctrl is held down)
Left Joystick: Letters
Right Joystick: Symbols (Numbers)
+ / select button: Undo (Redo)
```
